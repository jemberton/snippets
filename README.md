# snippets

A set of automation tools for Obsidian snippet switching.

## universal

This branch of the repository contains CSS stylesheets that *should* be universal with any theme. It does not attempt to be a theme on its own but does have some elements that set styles. This integration is meant to work using the Obsidian namespace for CSS, so it should be widely universal.
