# snippets

A set of automation tools for Obsidian snippet switching.

## Branches

### main

> [!note]
> This branch is a work in progress.

### stable

> [!note]
> This branch is the old Anuppuccin supported snippets. It does not have the capability to support *any* theme and is very biased towards the Anuppuccin theme. The chosen colors are for the "mocha" color scheme. If you use this branch, keep in mind it may be broken for any future versions.

### universal

> [!note]
> This branch is a work in progress.

This branch of the repository contains CSS stylesheets that *should* be universal with any theme. It does not attempt to be a theme on its own but does have some elements that set styles. This integration is meant to work using the Obsidian namespace for CSS, so it should be widely universal.

#### CSS Snippets

All snippets in this branch are meant to be independent of the specific theme in use in your vault. The theme you have enabled may have styles set for things other than color. If you are using a theme that makes major alterations to sizing and position of any rendered element, the snippets in this branch may conflict with the intended look and feel of your theme.

#### Mobile Support

The mobile support for the universal branch is an ongoing project. Different device sizes and color schemes make it difficult to find a good solution.

Git support for mobile is a mixed bag as well. Android users may have an easier time finding apps or support for easy repo copying. iOS users can use an app like a-shell with a bit of automation to help with managing the repo.
